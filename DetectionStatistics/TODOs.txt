- Summarize metrics on homepage manually (#event alerts, moderator time, event hit rate)

> Aggregate events info for analysis in Python (summarize_detections.py)
    instead of direct SQL queries to DB, check if querying the API works
    documentation: https://aifororcasdetections.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html
    will need update to fetch event info, and perf metrics

- Automatically keep aggregating detection events into Cosmos table
    3 hr agg window = 8*365 = ~3k rows/hydrophone/yr
    TODO add link reading on stored procedure new table thread

- Interactive dashboard (PowerBI) to query, explore events
    appears that Shahram likely did some powerbi setup (aifororcasmetadatasynapse) although i cannot find the dashboard
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/powerbi-visualize
    this Synapse thing appears to allow analysis on a prod/transaction DB without querying it directly, or needing an aggregation/ETL pipeline
        https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link
    (not read into details) seems a convenient nice-to-have if not too expensive
    but still need event data in a DB for the homepage

- Portal homepage to summarize & explore events (latest, last N time) and stats (FP rate, detection rate)
