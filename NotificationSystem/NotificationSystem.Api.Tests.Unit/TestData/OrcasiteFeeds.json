Can you hear whether sounds are to your left (south) or right (north)?</p>\n<p><strong>Status update 12/05/2024:</strong> Thanks to diver David Howitt, we know the cable was severed. The stream is now offline as we await new Aquarian hydrophones and a weather window to deploy them.</p>\n<p><strong>Status update 11/20/2024:</strong> The windstorm has damaged the HTI hydrophone. Please stand by while we work on a repair or replacement plan...</p>\n<p><strong>Status update:12/26/2023:</strong> The current hydrophone is an HTI at a depth of about 5 meters with intertidal tie-downs. It starting buzzing sometime recently.
