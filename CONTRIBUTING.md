## Code of Conduct

Please read and make sure you understand our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing to the project.

## Reporting Bugs

First, **ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under
[Issues](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/issues).

If you found a bug, you can help us by
[submitting a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/issues/new).
The best bug reports provide a detailed description of the issue and step-by-step instructions
for reliably reproducing the issue.

## Requesting New Features

You can request a new feature by [submitting a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/issues/new).

If you would like to implement a new feature, please first
[submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/issues/new) and
communicate your proposal so that the community can review and provide feedback. Getting
early feedback will help ensure your implementation work is accepted by the community.
This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts and minimize duplicated effort.

## Contributing Code

Orcasite is currently covered by the [MIT License](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/blob/main/LICENSE). When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
MIT License that covers the project. Copyright and license notices must be preserved.

If you are willing to follow the conditions of this license, check out the following links
to find an unassigned item to contribute to:

- ["Good first issue" GitHub issues for first-timers](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/labels/good%20first%20issue)
- [Public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/wBg0qhss/orcasound-roadmap)

Once you've chosen an issue and want to contribute code:

1. Fork the aifororcas-livesystem repo.
2. Develop on a [feature branch](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
3. Submit a PR (don't review your own)!
    - To maintain a consistent style, we recommend running [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), and `mix format` before submission.

#### C# Style Guidelines

For C# code contributions, please follow established style conventions to maintain code consistency:

- [Microsoft C# Identifier Naming Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/identifier-names) - Guidelines for naming classes, methods, variables, and other identifiers
- [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) - Best practices for formatting, commenting, and structuring C# code
- [Google C# Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html) - Additional style recommendations from Google's engineering teams

### Submitting a Pull Request

For all but the absolute simplest changes, first find an existing GitHub issue or
[submit a new issue](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/issues/new) so that the
community can review and provide feedback. Getting early feedback will help ensure your work
is accepted by the community. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts and
minimize duplicated effort.

If you would like to contribute, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute.
If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix. If you are
submitting a feature or substantial code contribution, please discuss it with the maintainers and
ensure it follows the public roadmap. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing
code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and
[Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.
All code submissions will be reviewed and tested, and only those that meet
the bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

For all [pull requests](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem/pulls) the following rules apply:
- The pull request description should describe the problem and solution, and reference the GitHub issue if one exists.
- Existing tests should continue to pass.
- Tests should ideally be included for every bug or feature that is completed.
- Documentation should be included for every feature that is end-user visible.
- Coding style should be consistent with the style used in other files of the same type in this repository.
