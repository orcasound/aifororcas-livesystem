## Model data 
The base data used here is hosted on Current test set for evaluation is hosted on [Orca Sound website ](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#test-sets). In specific the model was  trained with the following dataset -

- [WHOIS09222019_PodCastRound1](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#WHOIS_PodCastRound1) (~6hrs, open data source â€“ Orca call around the planet, Good for generic models)
- [OrcasoundLab07052019_PodCastRound2](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#OrcasoundLab07052019_PodCastRound2) (~1.2hrs, live hydrophone data - SRKW)
- [OrcasoundLab09272017_PodCastRound3](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#OrcasoundLab09272017_PodCastRound3) (~1.6hrs, live hydrophone data - SRKW)

And testing in evaluation section of FastAI start script is done on this data - 
- [OrcasoundLab07052019_Test](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#OrcasoundLab07052019_Test) (~30min, very call-rich, good SNR conditions)
- [OrcasoundLab09272017_Test](https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata/wiki/Pod.Cast-data-archive#OrcasoundLab07052019_Test) (~21min, more typical distribution, good SNR conditions)

## End-To-End development Process

### **Step 1**: Creating a more ML-ready dataset inline with other popular sound dataset - [1_DataCreation.ipynb notebook]()
- Extracting small audio segments for positive and negative label and store them in positive and negative folder for training  (Filtering any call with less than 1 second duration)
- Also create 2 sec audio sample from testing data for formal ML evaluation

### **Step2**: Transfer leaning a ResNet18 model with on the fly spectogram creation with frequency masking for data augmentation - [2_FastAI_StarterScript.ipynb]()
- Step 1: Create a Dataloader using FastAI library (Defining parameters to create a spectogram)
- Step 2: Create a DataBunch by splitting training data in 80:20% for validation using training phase, also defining augmentation technique (Frequency transformation)
- Step 3: Training a model using ResNet18 (pre-trained on ImageNet Data)
- Step 4: Running evaluation on Test set
- Step 5: Running scoring for official evaluation

### **Step3**: Inference Testing[3_InferenceTesting.ipynb]()
Notebook showing how to use the inference.py to load the model and do predictions by defining a clip path.
The inference.py returns a dictionary -
- **local_predictions**: A list of predictions (1/0) for each second of wav file (list of integers)
- **local_confidences**: A list of probability of the local prediction being a whale call or not (list of float)
- **global_predictions**: A global prediction(1/0) for the clip containing a valid whale call (integer)
- **global_confidences**: Probability of the prediction being a whale call or not(float)

- **Models/stg2-rn18.pkl** - Trained ResNet18 model
- **mldata.7z** is data used for training the model
- **All.zip** is testing data for early evaluations
- **test2Sec.zip** is data used for scoring for official evaluations
